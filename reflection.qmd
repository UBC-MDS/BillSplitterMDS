# Development Tools, Infrastructure, and Practices

This page discusses the tools, GitHub infrastructure, and organizational practices used in developing BillSplitterMDS, along with recommendations for scaling projects.

## Tools Used

### Version Control & Collaboration

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Git** | Distributed version control for tracking changes |
| **GitHub** | Repository hosting, issue tracking, project boards, code review |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD automation for testing, linting, and deployment |

### Testing & Quality Assurance

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **pytest** | Unit testing framework for Python |
| **pytest-cov** | Code coverage measurement |
| **Codecov** | Coverage tracking and reporting service |
| **ruff** | Fast Python linter for code style checking |

### Documentation

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Quarto** | Scientific and technical publishing system |
| **quartodoc** | Auto-generate API documentation from Python docstrings |
| **GitHub Pages** | Free hosting for documentation website |

### Packaging & Distribution

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **hatchling** | Modern Python build backend |
| **twine** | Package upload to PyPI/TestPyPI |
| **TestPyPI** | Testing package distribution before production release |

## Workflow Practices

### GitHub Flow (Primary Workflow)

For most development work, we followed GitHub Flow:

1. **Create feature branch** from `main`
2. **Make changes** and commit with meaningful messages
3. **Open pull request** for code review
4. **Address feedback** from team members
5. **Merge to main** after approval

This workflow is simple and effective for continuous deployment.

### Git Flow (Milestone 4)

For coordinated feature sets requiring multiple PRs, we used Git Flow:

1. **Create `development` branch** from `main`
2. **Create feature branches** from `development`
3. **Merge features** into `development` via reviewed PRs
4. **Final merge** of `development` into `main`

This provides a staging area to coordinate related changes before release.

### Code Review Practices

- Every PR requires at least one reviewer
- Use GitHub's review features (comments, suggestions, approvals)
- Check that CI passes before merging
- Squash commits for cleaner history when appropriate

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our automated pipeline includes:

```
Push/PR to main
    │
    ├── Run tests (pytest)
    │
    ├── Check code style (ruff)
    │
    ├── Measure coverage (pytest-cov)
    │
    └── Upload coverage (Codecov)

Release published
    │
    ├── Build package
    │
    └── Deploy to TestPyPI
```

## Recommendations for Scaling

If scaling this or another project, we recommend:

### 1. Enhanced Testing

- Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Add property-based testing with Hypothesis
- Set minimum coverage thresholds (e.g., 80%)

### 2. Type Safety

- Add type hints to all functions
- Use mypy for static type checking
- Include type checking in CI pipeline

### 3. Security

- Enable Dependabot for dependency updates
- Add secret scanning
- Use signed commits

### 4. Documentation

- Add more tutorials and use-case examples
- Include contribution guidelines for new developers
- Add changelog automation

### 5. Deployment

- Deploy to production PyPI (not just TestPyPI)
- Consider Docker containers for reproducibility
- Add staging environment for testing releases

### 6. Project Management

- Use GitHub Projects for sprint planning
- Automate issue triage with labels
- Set up milestone tracking and burndown charts

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Early CI/CD setup**: Catching issues early saved debugging time
- **Clear docstrings**: Made quartodoc documentation generation smooth
- **GitHub Issues**: Helped track work and communicate asynchronously
- **Code review**: Improved code quality and shared knowledge

### Challenges Faced

- **Coordinating changes**: Multiple people editing same files required communication
- **Documentation rendering**: Quarto/quartodoc setup had learning curve
- **Version management**: Keeping pyproject.toml and git tags in sync

### Key Takeaways

1. Invest time in tooling setup early - it pays dividends
2. Write tests as you code, not after
3. Document decisions in issues for future reference
4. Use meaningful commit messages for easier debugging

## Conclusion

The combination of GitHub Actions, pytest, ruff, and quartodoc provided a robust development infrastructure for BillSplitterMDS. These tools enabled automated quality checks, consistent code style, and professional documentation with minimal manual effort.

For future projects, we would maintain this toolset while adding type checking and expanding test coverage earlier in development.
